## General info
This project is a day planner app. It uses the moment.js library to display the current day in the format of day of week, month, day, year. It displays the "work" day hours of 9 am to 5 pm and allows you to enter your activities for each hour and save them to localStorage, so that when you refresh the page the activity entries remain. The hours are color coded depending on their relation to the current hour; past hour rows are displays as a gray background, the current hour row has a red background, and future hour rows display with a green background.

# Credits
I consulted Moment (https://momentjs.com/), jQuery API Documentation (https://api.jquery.com/), W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) extensively in creating my project. Some other resources that I used include: Stack Overflow (#https://stackoverflow.com/) and the GitLab repository for my course, specifically referencing the in-class activities.
